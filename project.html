        At ZIT, my first project called "Our Proud" celebrates the national anthem. 
        Using only HTML, we created a simple yet impactful experience. 
        The project includes audio of the anthem and images that evoke patriotism. 
        It's a tribute to our nation's pride and unity, showcasing the power of 
        simplicity in digital storytelling. With "Our Proud," we aim to inspire 
        a sense of belonging and appreciation for our heritage.

    <p>
        For my recent project, I made a Premium League table using HTML and CSS. 
        It shows stats for ten top teams, like their rank, matches played, wins, draws, 
        and goals against. At the top, you'll see the Premium League logo. It's easy to 
        use and helps fans see how well their favorite teams are doing in the league. With 
        clean formatting and clear organization, this table provides a straightforward 
        way for fans to stay updated on the latest standings and performances. Whether 
        you're a die-hard supporter or just curious about the league, this project offers 
        a user-friendly platform to engage with the exciting world of football.

       At the Orange Digital Center, my team and I embarked on an exhilarating project to 
        create a captivating 2D running game using JavaScript and Node.js. Drawing inspiration 
         from classic platformers, we combined our creativity and technical expertise to develop 
          a dynamic gaming experience that would delight players of all ages.

        Our game featured vibrant  graphics, smooth animations, and immersive sound effects, transporting players 
        to a thrilling world filled with  obstacles and challenges. Leveraging the power of Node.js,
         we implemented real-time 
         multiplayer functionality, allowing users to compete against friends or team up for cooperative gameplay.

        Throughout the development process, we collaborated closely, brainstorming ideas, refining mechanics, and overcoming obstacles together. With each line of code and iteration, we pushed the <br>
         boundaries of what was possible, striving to deliver a polished and engaging gaming experience.
