            <div class="p1"><p>In the big world of computers and the internet, my adventure began with a simple curiosity and a click of a mouse.  As I journeyed through the digital realm, I discovered the power of coding and the art of creating websites.

                My first steps into coding came with the ALX Software Engineer Scholarship, an online program where I learned the basics of  programming using a language called C. For three weeks, I dived deep into the world of  code, learning how to write commands and make computers do amazing things.

                Eager to explore more, I joined the Orange Digital Center coding school. Here, I learned how to make fun games using JavaScript and Kaboom. It was like being a wizard, using spells (code) to create magical worlds on the screen.

                But my journey didn't stop there. I wanted to learn about both coding and how to promote things online.</p>

                <div class="p2"><p>So, I enrolled in Max Business School's digital marketing program. While studying digital marketing, I decided  to put my coding skills to use and built my first WordPress website, saahjamesthesavvy.com.

                    Creating saahjamesthesavvy.com was like painting a picture with code. I learned how to design web pages, add  pictures, and make everything look just right. It was exciting to see my ideas come to life on the screen.
       
                       As I continued my studies, I learned more about WordPress and how to make websites that people would love to visit. Even though saahjamesthesavvy.com is no longer online, it will always be a special part of my journey, a symbol of how far I've come and how much I've learned.
       
                       Now, as I look ahead, I'm filled with excitement for what's next. Armed with my newfound skills and experiences, I'm ready to tackle new challenges and create even more amazing things in the world of coding and creating. The adventure continues, and I can't wait to see where it takes me next.</p>
